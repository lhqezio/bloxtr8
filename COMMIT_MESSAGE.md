# US-005: Implement Roblox Asset Ownership Verification System

## üéØ Overview

Complete implementation of User Story US-005: "As a user, I want to verify my Roblox asset ownership, so that buyers can trust my listings."

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Extensions

- **Enhanced RobloxSnapshot Model**: Added comprehensive asset tracking fields
  - `assetId`, `assetType`, `assetName`, `assetDescription`
  - `thumbnailUrl`, `currentPrice`, `originalPrice`
  - `copiesAvailable`, `totalCopies`
  - `verifiedOwnership`, `verificationDate`
  - Added proper indexes for performance

- **New AssetVerification Model**: Tracks ownership verification state
  - `verificationStatus`: PENDING, VERIFIED, FAILED, EXPIRED
  - `verificationMethod`: INVENTORY_API, ASSET_API, MANUAL
  - `verifiedAt`, `expiresAt` with 24-hour cache
  - `metadata` for API response storage

- **User Model Extension**: Added `assetVerifications` relation

### Core Services

#### RobloxApiClient (`apps/api/src/lib/roblox-api.ts`)

- OAuth authentication with client credentials
- Asset details retrieval via Roblox Catalog API
- User inventory verification via Roblox Inventory API
- Rate limiting and token management
- Comprehensive error handling

#### AssetVerificationService (`apps/api/src/lib/asset-verification.ts`)

- Asset ownership verification with caching
- Asset snapshot creation for listings
- User verified assets retrieval
- Integration with RobloxApiClient
- Database persistence with Prisma

#### RobloxRiskAssessmentService (`apps/api/src/lib/roblox-risk-assessment.ts`)

- Risk scoring based on asset age, volatility, rarity
- Suspicious activity detection framework
- Risk level determination (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Recommendation generation for high-risk assets

### API Endpoints (`apps/api/src/routes/asset-verification.ts`)

- `POST /api/asset-verification/verify` - Verify asset ownership
- `GET /api/asset-verification/user/:userId/assets` - Get verified assets
- `POST /api/asset-verification/snapshot` - Create asset snapshot for listing

### Discord Bot Integration (`apps/discord-bot/src/commands/listing-enhanced.ts`)

- New `/listing create-verified` command
- Asset verification modal workflow
- Interactive button-based listing creation
- Enhanced user experience with asset details display
- Integration with existing verification system

## üß™ Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for all services
  - RobloxApiClient authentication and API calls
  - AssetVerificationService verification logic
  - Error handling and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
  - Asset verification endpoints
  - Error response handling
  - Authentication integration

## üîß Configuration

- Environment variables for Roblox API credentials
- Database migration for schema changes
- Updated help command with new verified listing option

## üìä Key Features

1. **Real-time Asset Verification**: Direct integration with Roblox APIs
2. **Smart Caching**: 24-hour verification cache to reduce API calls
3. **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring for asset transactions
4. **Seamless UX**: Discord-native verification flow
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for verification events
6. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of API failures

## üîí Security Considerations

- OAuth token management with automatic refresh
- Input validation for all asset IDs
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Secure credential storage
- Audit logging for all verification events

## üöÄ Ready for Production

- All tests passing
- Database migrations created
- Environment configuration documented
- Discord bot commands registered
- API endpoints integrated

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready asset ownership verification system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Bloxtr8 architecture while maintaining security, performance, and user experience standards.
